    "# Tutorial 2: Betz Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have ran a simple calculator model using WISDEM, let's look at OpenMDAO. [OpenMDAO](http://openmdao.org) is the code that connects the various components of turbine models into a cohesive whole that can be optimized in systems engineering problems. WISDEM uses OpenMDAO to build up modular *components* and *groups* of components to represent a wind turbine.  Fortunately, OpenMDAO already provides some excellenet training examples on their [website](http://openmdao.org).  This tutorial is based on the OpenMDAO example, [Optimizing an Actuator Disk Model to Find Betz Limit for Wind Turbines](http://openmdao.org/twodocs/versions/latest/examples/betz_limit/betz.html), which we have extracted and added some additional commentary. The aim of this tutorial is to summarize the key points you'll use to create basic WISDEM models.  For those interested in WISDEM development, getting comfortable with all of the core OpenMDAO training examples is strongly encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic problem of wind energy engineering is the Betz limit. This is the theoretical upper limit of power that can be extracted from wind by an idealized rotor. While a full explanation is beyond the scope of this tutorial, it is explained in many places online and in textbooks. One such explanation is on Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Betz limit, the maximum power a turbine can extract from wind is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_p = \\frac{16}{27} \\approx 0.593 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\\\(C_p\\\\) is the coefficient of power.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compute this limit using OpenMDAO by optimizing the power coefficient as a function of the induction factor (ratio of rotor plane velocity to freestream velocity) and a model of an idealized rotor using an actuator disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our actuator disc:\n",
    "\n",
    "![actuator disc](img/actuator_disc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\\\(V_u\\\\) freestream air velocity, upstream of rotor, \\\\(V_r\\\\) is air velocity at rotor exit plane and \\\\(V_d\\\\) is slipstream air velocity downstream of rotor, all measured in \\\\(\\frac{m}{s}\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few other variables we'll have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\\\(a\\\\): Induced Velocity Factor\n",
    "- *Area*: Rotor disc area in \\\\(m^2\\\\)\n",
    "- *thrust*: Thrust produced by the rotor in N\n",
    "- \\\\(C_t\\\\): Thrust coefficient\n",
    "- *power*: Power produced by rotor in *W*\n",
    "- \\\\(\\rho\\\\): Air density in \\\\(kg /m^3\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start in on the source code, let's look at a few key snippets of the code\n",
