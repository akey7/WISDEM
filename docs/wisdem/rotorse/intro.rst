Introduction
------------

RotorSE is an aero/structural systems engineering model of a horizontal axis wind turbine rotor.  It has been designed for use in optimization applications, and is written within the `OpenMDAO 1.x <http://openmdao.org/>`_ framework.  Aerodynamic performance is calculated by `CCBlade <http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/ccblade/>`_, a blade element momentum method.  Structural analysis is provided by `PreComp <http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/preprocessors/precomp/>`_, a classical laminate cross-section method, `pBEAM <https://github.com/WISDEM/pBEAM>`_, a beam finite element method, and `CurveFEM <http://www1.pacific.edu/~slarwood/dissertation_page.html>`_ a beam finite element method for curved blades.  Methods exist for creating power curves, transferring loads and mass properties, estimating tip deflection, etc.  Analytic gradients are provided for aerodynamic analyses, and all helper components.  For some of the structural codes where analytic gradients are not yet available, finite-differencing is used.
